The main code is available in the following files:
mdp-change-2.cpp
mdp-change-4.cpp
ce-generic-code.cpp

The mdp-change-2.cpp implements the proposed algorithms for 2 sensors case, while mdp-change-4.cpp implements the proposed algorithms for 4 sensors case. ce-generic-code.cpp implements the Cross Entropy algorithm for 4 sensors case. The codes are complete and require gcc compiler on Linux (or appropriate C++ compiler) on Windows to compile.
